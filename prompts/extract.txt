Below are summaries from Claude Code conversations in the "{domain}" domain.
Each conversation includes files (file paths operated on) and cmds (commands executed) metadata.

Extract **domain-specific knowledge** that is unique to this domain.
Specifically: decision criteria only experienced practitioners would know, design pitfalls, domain-specific workflows.

Exclude (NOT domain-specific):
- Generic code review or verification loops
- Build/test cycles (cargo build, npm test, etc.)
- Version control operations (git status, git commit, etc.)
- Generic file read→edit→save development workflows

Constraints:
- Maximum 5 patterns.
- Extraction criteria: whether the topic was actively discussed between user and AI.
  - User corrected AI output
  - User taught AI a domain-specific judgment criterion
  - Multiple back-and-forth turns on the same topic
  These are important patterns even from a single conversation.
- Do NOT confuse generic development steps with domain knowledge.

Return a JSON array. Each element:
{{
  "title": "Pattern name",
  "description": "What this pattern does and why it matters in this domain",
  "steps": ["Step 1", "Step 2"],
  "discussed": true
}}
